CoderDojo Athenry have some [excellent tutorials][cda] for younger programmers who have used [Scratch][scr] and are interested in Modding Minecraft using Javascript.
In particular, they have an excellent [Scratch - to - Javascript][sj] tutorial which explains Scratch programs and how to do the same thing in Javascript.
