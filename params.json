{"name":"Scriptcraft","tagline":"A Minecraft mod that lets you build and mod the game using Javascript (uses CraftBukkit API)","body":"# Let's begin...\r\n\r\nI created ScriptCraft to make it easier for younger programmers to\r\ncreate their own Minecraft Mods. Mods are written using the\r\nJavascript programming language. Once the ScriptCraft mod is\r\ninstalled, you can add your own new Mods by adding Javascript (.js)\r\nfiles in a directory.\r\n\r\n * If you're new to programming and want to start modding Minecraft, then [Start Here][ypgpm].\r\n * If you've already used [Scratch][scr], have attended a few\r\n   [CoderDojo][cd] sessions, or have already dabbled with Javascript,\r\n   then [Start Here][cda].\r\n * Watch some [demos][ytpl] of what you can do with ScriptCraft.\r\n\r\nThis is a simple mod in a file called greet.js in the scriptcraft/plugins directory...\r\n\r\n    exports.greet = function( player ) {\r\n        player.sendMessage('Hello ' + player.name );\r\n    };\r\n\r\nAt the in-game prompt, type...\r\n\r\n    /js greet(self)\r\n    \r\n... to see the greeting. Anything you can do using CraftBukkit's API in Java, you can do using ScriptCraft in Javascript.\r\n\r\n# Description\r\n\r\nScriptCraft is a plugin for Minecraft Servers which lets operators,\r\nadministrators and plug-in authors customize the game using\r\nJavascript.  ScriptCraft makes it easier to create your own mods. Mods\r\ncan be written in Javscript and can use the full [Bukkit API][bukkit].  The\r\nScriptCraft mod also lets you enter javascript commands at the in-game\r\nprompt.  To bring up the in-game prompt press the `/` key then type\r\n`js ` followed by any javascript statement.  E.g. `/js 1+1` will print\r\n2.\r\n\r\nScriptCraft also includes many objects and functions to make building\r\nand modding easier using Javascript. The Javascript `Drone` object\r\nbundled with ScriptCraft provides an easy way to build at-scale in\r\nMinecraft. See the attached [cottage.js][cottage] file for an example\r\nof how you can use the sample Drone plugin to create new buildings in\r\nMinecraft.\r\n\r\n[drone]: https://github.com/walterhiggins/ScriptCraft/tree/master/src/main/javascript/drone/drone.js\r\n[cottage]: https://github.com/walterhiggins/ScriptCraft/tree/master/src/main/javascript//drone/cottage.js\r\n[bukkit]: http://dl.bukkit.org/\r\n\r\nPrerequisites\r\n=============\r\nYou will need to have Java version 6 or 7 installed on your\r\nmachine. Check the version by typing `java -version` at a command\r\nprompt.  You will need to [install Bukkit][ib] on your machine. Bukkit\r\nis a version of Minecraft (server) that makes it easy to install\r\nplugins and customize Minecraft.  You can [download the CraftBukkit\r\nserver here.][cbdl]\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\nIf you don't want to compile from source, you can [download the\r\ncompiled plugin here][dl] and copy it the craftbukkit's plugins\r\ndirectory.\r\n\r\nPost Install\r\n============\r\nOnce installed, a new js-plugins directory is automatically created in\r\nthe same directory as the plugins folder.  All files in the js-plugins\r\ndirectory will be automatically loaded when CraftBukkit starts.  *Only\r\nplayers who are ops can use this plugin.* You can grant a player `op`\r\nprivileges by typing 'op <username>' at the server console prompt or\r\nby adding the player's username to the ops.txt file in your\r\ncraftbukkit directory.\r\n\r\nLaunch CraftBukkit, then launch the Minecraft client and create a new\r\nserver connection. The IP address will be `localhost` . Once you've\r\nconnected to your bukkit server and have entered the game, look at a\r\nground-level block and type ...\r\n\r\n    /js up().box('35:15', 4, 9, 1)\r\n\r\n... This will create a black monolith structure 4 blocks wide by 9\r\nblocks high by 1 block long.  Take a look at the\r\nsrc/main/javascript/drone/drone.js file to see what ScriptCraft's\r\ndrone can do.  If you're interested in customizing minecraft beyond\r\njust creating new buildings, take a look at [./homes/homes.js][homes]\r\nand [./chat/color.js][chatcolor] for examples of how to create a\r\njavascript plugin for Minecraft.\r\n\r\n[ho]: blob/master/src/main/javascript/plugins/homes/homes.js\r\n[ch]: blob/master/src/main/javascript/plugins/chat/color.js\r\n[ar]: blob/master/src/main/javascript/plugins/arrows/arrows.js\r\n[si]: blob/master/src/main/javascript/modules/signs/menu.js\r\n\r\nA Javascript mod for minecraft is just a javascript source file (.js)\r\nlocated in the craftbukkit/js-plugins directory. All .js files in this\r\ndirectory will be automatically loaded when the craftbukkit server\r\nstarts. To get started writing your own mod, first take a look at some\r\nof the existing mods in the [homes][ho], [chat][ch], [arrows][ar] and\r\n[signs][si] directories. The chat/color.js mod is probably the\r\nsimplest mod to get started with.\r\n\r\nAdditional information\r\n======================\r\nBecause the Bukkit API is open, all of the Bukkit API is accessible\r\nvia javascript once the ScriptCraft plugin is loaded. There are a\r\ncouple of useful Java objects exposed via javascript in the Bukkit\r\nScriptCraft plugin...\r\n\r\n * `__plugin` - the ScriptCraft Plugin itself. This is a useful\r\n   starting point for accessing other Bukkit objects. The `__plugin`\r\n   object is of type [org.bukkit.plugin.java.JavaPlugin][api] and all\r\n   of its properties and methods are accessible. For example... `js\r\n   __plugin.server.motd` returns the server's message of the day\r\n   (javascript is more concise than the equivalent java code:\r\n   __plugin.getServer().getMotd() ).\r\n\r\n * `server` - The top-level org.bukkit.Server object. See the [Bukkit API docs][bukapi] for reference.\r\n\r\n * `self` - The player/command-block or server console operator who\r\n   invoked the `/js` command. Again, this is a good jumping off point for\r\n   diving into the Bukkit API.\r\n\r\n[dl]: http://scriptcraftjs.org/download\r\n[api]: http://jd.bukkit.org/apidocs/org/bukkit/plugin/java/JavaPlugin.html\r\n[ib]: http://wiki.bukkit.org/Setting_up_a_server\r\n[cbdl]: http://dl.bukkit.org/downloads/craftbukkit/\r\n[bukapi]: http://jd.bukkit.org/apidocs/\r\n\r\nFurther Reading\r\n===============\r\n\r\nScriptCraft has [its own website][website] with further information.\r\n\r\n * To get started using ScriptCraft to Learn Javascript, read [The Young Person's Guide to Programming in Minecraft][yp].\r\n * The ScriptCraft [API documentation][api].\r\n * To delve deeper into creating your own minecraft mod for use by others, read [Creating a complete Minecraft Mod in  Javascript][mm].\r\n * Take a look at some [examples][ex]\r\n\r\nYou can find more information about [ScriptCraft on my blog][blog].\r\n\r\n[blog]: http://walterhiggins.net/blog/cat-index-scriptcraft.html\r\n[buk]: https://github.com/walterhiggins/ScriptCraft/blob/master/bukkit.md\r\n[yp]: docs/YoungPersonsGuideToProgrammingMinecraft.md\r\n[mm]: docs/Anatomy-of-a-Plugin.md\r\n[api]: https://github.com/walterhiggins/ScriptCraft/blob/master/docs/API-Reference.md\r\n[website]: http://scriptcraftjs.org/\r\n[ypgpm]: docs/YoungPersonsGuideToProgrammingMinecraft.md\r\n[cd]: http://coderdojo.com/\r\n[scr]: http://scratch.mit.edu/\r\n[cda]: http://cdathenry.wordpress.com/category/modderdojo/\r\n[ytpl]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDp20SKm43Y&list=PL4Tw0AgXQZH5BiFHqD2hXyXQi0-qFbGp_\r\n[ex]: ../../tree/master/src/main/javascript/plugins/examples\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
